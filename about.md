Hi! I'm a second year computer science student currently studying at [Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk). I currently have no special body of knowledge, but am attempting to immerse myself in all of the parts of computer science that I like in order to find one or two that I *really* like.

Apart from being something to fill up my domain name, I'm hoping to use this website for sharing links that I find to be interesting or useful (tumblr style) and simply for better justifying my ideas by writing them down.

If you find something interesting here and wish to contact me, please feel free to [email](mailto:j.baker@outlook.com). If you find an article to be incorrect, I'd be really grateful if you commented directly, emailed or submitted a pull request - this site has a [git repository](https://www.github.com/j-baker/j-baker.github.io).
